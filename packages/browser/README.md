# ðŸ–¥ Borf: Browser

![bundle size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@borf/browser?style=flat&label=gzipped%20size)

This is the front-end (browser) component of [Borf](https://www.borfjs.com). It handles [routing](#routing), components (two types; [views](#views) and [stores](#stores)) and [data binding](#state), all out of the box, aiming to cover the common needs of modern web apps while striking a balance between features and size.

## Installation

### CDN

This package includes everything you need to make a fully functioning web app by importing the `@borf/browser` module from a CDN. This is the fastest way to get code running in a browser with no compilation or bundling.

```js
// Using Skypack:
import { ... } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@borf/browser";

// Using unpkg:
import { ... } from "https://unpkg.com/@borf/browser";
```

### NPM

Most projects will install `@borf/browser` from npm. Best used in combination with `@borf/build` which adds support for JSX, a dev server with auto-reload, optimized production builds and more. Run this in your project directory:

```
$ npm i -D @borf/build @borf/browser
```

And the imports will look like this:

```js
import { ... } from "@borf/browser";
```

## Hello World

Suppose you have two files on your web server:

```
index.html
app.js
```

Inside `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Borf Demo</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main id="app">
      <!-- app goes here -->
    </main>

    <script async src="./app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Inside `app.js`:

```js
import { App } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@borf/browser";

const app = new App();

// A root view is always displayed while the app is connected.
app.addRootView((ctx, m) => {
  return m("h1", "Hello world!");
});

// Display this app inside the element with `id="app"`
app.connect("#app");
```

Most methods on App are chainable, so you could condense the above example thus:

```js
new App()
  .addRootView((ctx, m) => {
    return m("h1", "Hello world!");
  })
  .connect("#app");
```

Now when you visit the page the document should look something like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Fronte Demo</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main id="app">
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </main>

    <script async src="./app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Routing

Most web apps today are what's known as an SPA, or single-page app, consisting of one HTML page with links to bundled app code. This code uses browser APIs to simulate navigation between multiple "pages" by swapping out page content based on the URL, but retains all JavaScript state that would normally be lost between page loads because no actual page loads take place. Despite the illusion of moving around the app, you never actually leave that one HTML page. This technique is generally known as client-side routing.

`@borf/browser` makes heavy use of client-side routing. You can define as many routes as you have views, and the URL will determine which one the app shows at any given time.

By building an app around routes, lots of things we expect from a web app will just work; back and forward buttons, sharable URLs, bookmarks, etc.

Routing in Borf is aesthetically inspired by [choo.js](https://www.choo.io/docs/routing)
with technical inspiration from [@reach/router](https://reach.tech/router/), as routes are matched by highest specificity regardless of the order they were registered. This avoids some confusing situations that come up with order-based routers like that of `express`. On the other hand, order-based routers can support regular expressions as patterns which Borf's router cannot.

### Route Patterns

Routes are identified by strings called patterns. A pattern defines the shape the path must match, with special placeholders for variables that appear within the route. Values matched by those placeholders are exposed for use in your code. Below are some examples of patterns and how they work.

- Static: `/this/is/static` has no params and will match only when the route is exactly `/this/is/static`.
- Numeric params: `/users/{#id}/edit` has the named param `{#id}` which matches numbers only, such as `123` or `52`. The resulting value will be parsed as a number.
- Generic params: `/users/{name}` has the named param `{name}` which matches anything in that position in the path. The resulting value will be a string.
- Wildcard: `/users/*` will match anything beginning with `/users` and store everything after that in params as `wildcard`. `*` is valid only at the end of a route.

Now, here are some route examples in the context of an app:

```js
import { PersonDetails, ThingIndex, ThingDetails, ThingEdit, ThingDelete } from "./components.js";

const app = new App();

app
  .addRoute("/people/{name}", PersonDetails)

  // Routes can be nested. Also, a `null` component with subroutes acts as a namespace for those subroutes.
  // Passing a view instead of `null` results in subroutes being rendered inside that view wherever `ctx.outlet()` is called.
  .addRoute("/things", null, (sub) => {
    sub.addRoute("/", ThingIndex); // matches `/things`
    sub.addRoute("/{#id}", ThingDetails); // matches `/things/{#id}`
    sub.addRoute("/{#id}/edit", ThingEdit); // matches `/things/{#id}/edit`
    sub.addRoute("/{#id}/delete", ThingDelete); // matches `/things/{#id}/delete`
  });
```

As you can infer from the code above, once a route matches a pattern the corresponding view is displayed. Params can be accessed inside those views through the built-in `router` store:

```js
const ThingDetails = View.define({
  setup(ctx, m) {
    // `router` store allows you to work with the router from inside the app.
    const router = ctx.useStore("router");

    // Info about the current route is exported as a set of Readables. Query params are also Writable through $$query:
    const { $path, $pattern, $params, $$query } = router;

    // Functions are exported for navigation:
    const { back, forward, navigate } = router;

    back(); // Step back in the history to the previous route, if any.
    back(2); // Hit the back button twice.

    forward(); // Step forward in the history to the next route, if any.
    forward(4); // Hit the forward button 4 times.

    navigate("/things/152"); // Navigate to another path within the same app.
    navigate("https://www.example.com/another/site"); // Navigate to another domain entirely.

    // Three ways to confirm with the user that they wish to navigate before actually doing it.
    navigate("/another/page", { prompt: true });
    navigate("/another/page", { prompt: "Are you sure you want to leave and go to /another/page?" });
    navigate("/another/page", { prompt: PromptView });

    // Get the live value of `{#id}` from the current path.
    const $id = $params.as((p) => p.id);

    // Render it into a <p> tag. The ID portion will update if the URL changes.
    return m("p", "Thing's ID is ", $id);
  },
});
```

## State

In a Borf app, all data that changes is stored in a State. All interested parties subscribe to that State and update themselves automatically. Borf has no virtual DOM or re-rendering. Components render once, and everything beyond that is a side effect of a State change.

```js
import { View, State } from "@borf/browser";

/**
 * Displays a timer that shows an ever-incrementing count of seconds elapsed.
 * Also displays a button to reset the timer to 0.
 */
const Timer = View.define({
  label: "TimerExample",
  setup(ctx) {
    // Use regular variables to store data. Setup is only called once, so this function scope is here for the lifetime of the view.
    let interval = null;

    // the $$ naming convention indicates a binding is writable (supports .set, .update, ...)
    const $$seconds = new State(0);

    // the $ naming convention denotes a read-only binding
    const $seconds = $$seconds.readable();

    function increment() {
      // Update uses a function to derive a new value from the current one.
      $$seconds.update((value) => value + 1);
    }

    function reset() {
      // Set replaces the current value with a new one.
      $$seconds.set(0);
    }

    // Increment once per second after the view is connected to the DOM.
    ctx.onConnect(function () {
      interval = setInterval(increment, 1000);
    });

    // Stop incrementing when the view is disconnected.
    ctx.onDisconnect(function () {
      clearInterval(interval);
    });

    return (
      <div class="timer">
        <span>{$seconds}</span>

        {/* Button calls reset() when clicked */}
        <button onclick={reset}>Reset</button>
      </div>
    );
  },
});
```

## Views

Views are a type of component that displays DOM nodes. If you've used components in React, Angular, Vue, or others, this is pretty much what you're used to. You can define a view once and reuse it anywhere you want as many times as you want.

```jsx
const Example = View.define({
  setup: (ctx) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{ctx.inputs.get("title")}</h1>
        <p>This is a reusable view.</p>
      </div>
    );
  },
});

// Views can be mounted directly on a route
app.addRoute("/example", Example);

// They can also be used inside another view
app.addRoute("/other", (ctx) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Example title="In Another View" />
    </div>
  );
});
```

### View Context

Views receive a context object they may use to translate state and lifecycle into DOM nodes.

```js
const Example = View.define({
  setup: (ctx, m) => {
    // Access the built-in stores by name
    const http = ctx.useStore("http");
    const page = ctx.useStore("page");
    const router = ctx.useStore("router");
    const dialog = ctx.useStore("dialog");
    const language = ctx.useStore("language");

    // Access custom stores by reference
    const some = ctx.useStore(SomeStore);
    const other = ctx.useStore(OtherStore);

    /*=================================*\
    ||             Logging             ||
    \*=================================*/

    ctx.log("Something happened.");
    ctx.warn("Something happened!");
    ctx.error("SOMETHING HAPPENED!!!!");
    ctx.crash(new Error("FUBAR"));

    /*=================================*\
    ||              State              ||
    \*=================================*/

    // Creates a writable (two-way) binding with a default value.
    const $$title = new State("The Default Title");

    // Runs a callback function each time a state changes (or any observable emits a value).
    ctx.subscribe($$title, (title) => {
      console.log("title attribute changed to " + title);
    });

    // Merge two or more bindings into a single binding.
    const $formattedTitle = State.merge([$$title, some.$uppercase], (title, uppercase) => {
      if (uppercase) {
        return title.toUpperCase();
      }

      return title;
    });

    /*=================================*\
    ||            Lifecycle            ||
    \*=================================*/

    ctx.isConnected; // true if view is connected

    ctx.onConnect(() => {
      // Runs after the view is added to the page.
    });

    ctx.onDisconnect(() => {
      // Runs after the view is removed from the page.
    });

    ctx.animateIn(async () => {});

    ctx.animateOut(async () => {});

    /*=================================*\
    ||      Rendering & Children       ||
    \*=================================*/

    m.when();
    m.unless();
    m.observe();
    m.repeat();

    // Render children inside a `<div class="container">`
    return m("div", { class: "container" }, ctx.outlet());
  },
});
```

### Templating

Templating is how you create elements. There are two ways to do it; first is calling the `m`arkup function which is passed as the second argument to `setup`.

The markup function has these signatures:

```js
m(tagname, [attributes, ][...children])
m(view, [inputs, ][...children])
```

```jsx
const Example = View.define({
  label: "ExampleView",
  setup: (ctx, m) => {
    return m("section", [
      m("h1", "Item List"),
      m("p", { style: "color: red" }, "Below is a list of items."),
      m("ul", [
        m("li", "Item 1"),
        m("li", { class: "active" }, "Item 2"),
        m("li", "Item 3"),
        m("li", "Item 4"),
        m("li", "Item 5"),
        m("li", "Item 6"),
      ]),
    ]);
  },
});
```

The second is using JSX. You can do this when building with `@borf/build`, but it won't work out of the box in a browser.

> Note that Borf uses a `class` attribute like HTML rather than `className` like React.

```jsx
const Example = View.define({
  label: "ExampleView",
  setup: (ctx, m) => {
    return (
      <section>
        <h1>Item List</h1>
        <p style="color: red">Below is a list of items.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Item 1</li>
          <li class="active">Item 2</li>
          <li>Item 3</li>
          <li>Item 4</li>
          <li>Item 5</li>
          <li>Item 6</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    );
  },
});
```
