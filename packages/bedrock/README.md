Bedrock is a toolbox of functions used by other Borf packages.

## What's in it?

- Type checking utilities (isNumber, isObject, isArrayOf, etc.)
- Type assertion utilities (assertNumber, assertObject, assertArrayOf, etc.)
- Route parsing and matching functions

See source code for details. Everything is well commented.
