# Dev Tools Scratchpad

- View component tree (uses debug.name to identify components)
- Inspect component state
- Browse and inspect services
- See which services a component is using
- See which routes are currently loaded
- View debug.log messages scoped to the selected component or service

> This idea has kind of been absorbed into what used to be `@woofjs/view` and is now called `@woofjs/window`. Now that
> views and globals have their own state, that state can be inspected while viewing a window.
