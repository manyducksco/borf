# Naming of 'attrs'

I don't like 'attrs' because it's an abbreviation. I think a full word would look better. Possible alternatives:

- 'attributes' (good but feels a little long to type out, aligns with HTML terms)
- 'props' (still an abbreviation, familiar to react users)
- 'inputs' (shorter and explicit about where they come from)
- 'fields' (kind of odd)
